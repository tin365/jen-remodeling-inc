# JEN Remodeling Inc — Legal, Compliance & Professional Recommendations

Recommendations for a **US-incorporated** remodeling company website. Not legal advice; have an attorney review before publishing.

---

## 1. Legal pages (recommended / required)

| Page | Why |
|------|-----|
| **Privacy Policy** | **Recommended/required:** You collect names, emails, phones, and messages (contact form and reviews). Many states (e.g. California, Virginia, Colorado) and general best practice require a privacy policy if you collect personal information. Include: what you collect, how you use it, who you share it with (e.g. Supabase, Resend), how long you keep it, and how users can contact you or request deletion. |
| **Terms of Service / Terms of Use** | **Recommended:** Sets rules for use of the site, disclaimers, limitation of liability, and (if applicable) that estimates are not binding contracts. |
| **Cookie / tracking notice** | **Optional but good:** If you use Sentry, analytics, or any cookies beyond strictly necessary, a short notice or banner (e.g. “We use cookies to improve the site and for error reporting”) with a link to your Privacy Policy is good practice. |

**Action:** Add `/privacy` and `/terms` routes and link them in the footer. Use placeholder content until your lawyer provides final text.

## 2. Contractor licensing & disclosure (USA)

Many states **require** contractor license numbers on **advertising**, including websites. Rules vary by state.

- **Check your state:** State contractor licensing board (e.g. “Contractors State License Board” in California). Often the license number must appear on ads, contracts, and sometimes the website.
- **If you’re licensed:** Add your **license number(s)** to the site (e.g. footer, Contact page, or a “Licensing” line under “Licensed & Insured”). Example: *“Licensed in [State]: #XXXXX.”*
- **If you work in multiple states:** List each state and license number if required there.
- **Bonding:** If you’re bonded, saying “Licensed, Bonded & Insured” and (if required) bond info can build trust.

**Action:** Replace the generic “Licensed & Insured” line with real license number(s) and state(s) where applicable.

---

## 3. Incorporation & business identity

- **Legal name:** Use the exact legal name (e.g. “JEN Remodeling Inc”) in footer and key pages. You already do this.
- **State of incorporation:** Optionally add one line in footer or About: *“JEN Remodeling Inc is incorporated in [State].”*
- **Address:** Use a **real business address** (not a placeholder). Many states require a physical address for contractors. Replace “123 Remodeling Street, Your City, ST 12345” everywhere.
- **Phone & email:** Use real contact details. Replace “(123) 456-7890” and ensure “info@jenremodeling.com” (or your real email) is correct.

**Action:** Replace all placeholder address, phone, and email with real company details.

---

## 4. Trust & credibility

- **Insurance:** You mention “Licensed & Insured.” Consider adding one short line that you carry general liability (and workers’ comp if applicable). No need to list policy numbers on the site.
- **Service area:** Clearly state **where you serve** (e.g. “Serving [County], [State] and surrounding areas”). Reduces disputes and sets expectations.
- **Warranty / guarantee:** You mention “Quality Guaranteed” and “Satisfaction Assured.” If you have a written warranty or guarantee, add a short summary or a link to a page that describes it.
- **Reviews:** You already have reviews; keep them and consider highlighting that they are from real customers (no fake reviews; FTC and state laws apply).

**Action:** Add a “Service area” line or section; optionally a short “Warranty” or “Our guarantee” section or page.

---

## 5. Accessibility (ADA / Section 508)

Public-facing business sites are often expected to be reasonably accessible (e.g. ADA, state laws).

- **Basics:** You use semantic HTML and some ARIA. Keep keyboard navigation, focus states, alt text for images, and sufficient color contrast.
- **Forms:** Labels, error messages, and required fields are clear (you already have good structure).
- **Optional:** Run Lighthouse accessibility audits; fix critical issues. Consider a short “Accessibility” statement (e.g. “We aim to make our site accessible; if you have trouble, contact us at [email/phone]”).

**Action:** Run an accessibility check; add an accessibility statement if you want to state your commitment.

## 6. Features to consider adding

| Feature | Benefit |
|--------|--------|
| **FAQ** | Reduces repetitive contact questions; good for SEO. |
| **Service area page or section** | Clear “where we work”; helps SEO and sets expectations. |
| **Warranty / guarantee page** | Clarifies what you stand behind. |
| **Before/after gallery** | You have this (Projects). Keep it updated. |
| **Financing** | If you offer or partner with financing, a short section can help conversions. |
| **Permits** | A line like “We handle permit applications where required” can reassure homeowners. |

---

## 7. Content & copy rules

- **Don’t promise specific results** (e.g. “We will get your permit”) unless you can guarantee them; use “we can assist” or “where required.”
- **Estimates:** Make clear that online or phone estimates are approximate and that a written estimate after a site visit is what counts (if that’s your policy). Your Terms can state this.
- **Reviews:** Do not fake reviews; do not offer incentives in exchange for positive reviews without clear disclosure (FTC guidelines).

## 8. Quick checklist before going live

- [ ] **Terms of Service** page live and linked in footer (optional but recommended).
